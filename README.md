## What is this?
*GitHub Integration* is a addon for Godot Engine that I've created mainly for a personal purpose.  
Pushing and Pulling personal repositories while I'm working on Godot (especially if I'm under a GameJam) could take some time and force me to save the project, open the brwoser/git bash/git gui, and do all the stuff.  
With this little addon which works directly in the editor, managing all your repositories will be very easy.  

## How does it work?
I'm currently working on a [Wiki](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration/wiki) for this plugin. It is a process that will take some time to complete since I want to provide a well-organized wiki with some basic explanations about GitHub itself. Anyway, I'm working on a user-friendly plugin, so everything should be the very ease to use for GitHub experienced users, and a little intuitive for people who never used GitHub or are not so experienced.

For my first donation I decided to add a SUPPORTERS.md file where there is a list of people who decided to financially support this plugin. I will never ask for anything in return for the free service I want to offer to  Godot's community, but it will always be an act of kindness that will encourage me to keep my plugins and projects updated.
Here's the [Supporters List](./SUPPORTERS.md)
